    <h3> Certification Process </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Students will complete an online questionnaire that verifies the sustainability tier that that room qualifies for.
        </li>
        <li>
           It is possible to not qualify for a sustainability tier at all, in which case students can attempt to take the questionnaire again after they have made their room more sustainable. 
        </li>
        <li>
           The questionnaire will show them how they can become more sustainable. Students must recertify each year and can move up a sustainability tier at any time.
        </li>
        <li>
           Each student in each room must take the online questionnaire, the room is given the lowest tier qualified. 
        </li>
      </ol>

    <h3> Incentives for Students / Houses </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
           House-Wide Incentive: Incorporate Green Room Certifications into the year long Green Cup competition 
      </li>
      <li>
           Individual Incentives: Green = stickers, Silver = OFS sustainability bags, Gold = Harvard swag gear 
      </li>      
    </ul>

    <h3> REPS will verify applications for students </h3>
    <p>
         REPs will briefly go over the questionnaire with student at a study break or maybe an 'office hours'. After that she will give incentive and the certification sticker to the student. This will hopefully make the effects of the Green Room Certification program stickier.

    <h3> Data Collection </h3>
    <p>
  From either the questionnaires or the REP verification process, information necessary to display and publicize the data online will be collected from the student (of the certified room).
